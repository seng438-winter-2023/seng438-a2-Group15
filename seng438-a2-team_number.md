# 1 Introduction

This lab is designed to put into practice writing smart and concise JUnit Test Cases, developing Test Suites,
and Mocking Framework using Mockito or JMock to see how we can pass values and throw exceptions as well as investigate
as to why the behaviour acts this way, which gives it more functionality that a simple test stub.
We will also gain understanding of two main types of Black Box Techniques such as Equivalence Class Partitioning and 
Boundary Value Testing and what values and classes are appropriate given a set of Ranges.

# 2 Detailed description of unit test strategy

// including the input partitions you have designed

# 3 Test cases developed

Text…

// write down the name of the test methods and classes. Organize the based on
the source code method // they test. identify which tests cover which partitions
you have explained in the test strategy section //above

# 4 How the team work/effort was divided and managed
